My favourite vim colourscheme
=============================

*WARNING* This is updated to vim 8.0 native package layout, which breaks
compatibility with previous layout.

My custom colourscheme is based on dark `default` vim scheme, but is tweaked
somewhat. At present there is only dark variant for `*-256color` terminals.
Planned is 88-colours for rxvt.

See [preview at vimcolors.com](https://vimcolors.com/287/woju/dark), but mind
that background and normal colors are borked (ie, they should be white on
black).

Configuration
-------------
